#dotfiles

This repository gathers all the files of my configurations. Mostly, this repository is to ease the vim set up process on all the computer that I use. 

Feel free to download if you want to. Keep in mind, however, that I am but a novice in Vim. 

To use this, make sure that a symlink to the vimrc file 
$ln -s ~/dotfiles/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

If the curl command is installed on your computer, the file will copy all configuration of vim and install all the necesarry plugins.
